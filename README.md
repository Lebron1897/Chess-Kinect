# Chess-Kinect
In this project I tried to make a functional game of chess using a sensor Kinect, by programming the functions of voice and motion recognition that it has built-in.

Mainly it has been achieved the operation of the time recognition to carry out most of the actions that interested us.

# Functionalities implemented:
- Recognition of voice commands needed to perform all functions of the game.
- Generation of the board at different game angles along with all the tiles and their corresponding pictures of each.
- 

# Bugs in the program:
- It has not been possible to implement motion recognition in order to be able to control the parts directly with a movement of the hand.
- It has also not been possible to implement the dashboard in such a way that it can work on the various changes in which the dashboard camera can be seen.
